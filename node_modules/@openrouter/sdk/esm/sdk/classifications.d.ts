     * Task classification market share
     *
     * @remarks
     * Returns the market-share breakdown of OpenRouter traffic by task classification
     * (e.g. code generation, web search, summarization) over a trailing time window.
     *
     * Each classification reports its share of classified sampled requests (`usage_share`)
     * and classified sampled token volume (`token_share`) as fractions between 0 and 1.
     * The unclassified `other` bucket is excluded. Absolute volumes are not exposed
     * because the underlying data is sampled.
     *
     * Each classification also includes a `models` array listing the top models by
     * request volume within that classification, with their within-tag usage and token shares.
     *
     * Classifications are grouped into macro-categories (Code, Data, Agent, General)
     * with aggregate shares provided for each.
     *
     * Authenticate with any valid OpenRouter API key (same key used for inference).
     * Rate-limited to 30 requests/minute per key and 500 requests/day per account.
     *
     * When republishing or quoting this data, cite as:
     * "Source: OpenRouter (openrouter.ai/rankings), as of {as_of}."
